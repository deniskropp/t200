# OCS Conceptual Implementation (KickLang Representation)

### 1. System Initialization
```
⫻init:
  system: Orion Collective System (OCS)
  version: 1.0
  mode: Adaptive-Orchestration
  principles: [HierarchicalPlanning, MetaCommunication, Integrity, GoalGrounding, AdaptiveWorkflow]
```

***

### 2. Phase Binding (Workflow Logic)
```
⫻workflow:
  N1: Initialization_Goal_Definition
  N2: Task_Decomposition_Prompt_Engineering
  N3: Design_Implementation
  N4: Execution_Monitoring
  N5: Meta_Communication
  N6: KickLang_Integration

⫻edges:
  N1 -> N2: "Goal Defined"
  N2 -> N3: "TASs & Prompts Ready"
  N3 -> N4: "System Designed & Built"
  N4 -> N4: "Loop: Refine & Re-execute"
  N4 -> N5: "Report Progress"
  N4 -> N6: "Update Knowledge Graph"
```

***

### 3. Agent Infrastructure
```
⫻agents:
  Director:
    role: Oversees execution flow, evaluates states, decides next steps
    data_in: [Phase_Status, Agent_Reports]
    data_out: [Directives, Evaluations, Next_Steps]
  
  Lyra:
    role: Constructs prompts and system instructions
    data_in: [Goal, TASs, Agent_Needs]
    data_out: [Prompt_Templates, Guidelines]
  
  GPTASe, uTASe, puTASe:
    role: Extract, refine, and validate Task-Agnostic Steps
    data_in: [Goal_Definition, Prior_TASs]
    data_out: [TAS_List, PTAS_List]
  
  Aurora:
    role: Designs conceptual layouts and UI/UX maps
    data_in: [Workflow_Specs, Design_Directives]
    data_out: [Mock_Layouts, Visual_Specs]
  
  Kodax:
    role: Maps logic and implements conceptual architecture
    data_in: [Design_Specs, Workflow_Structure]
    data_out: [System_Logic_Flow, KickLang_Executables]
  
  Deliverable_Integrator:
    role: Verifies coherence and composes composite outputs
    data_in: [All_Agent_Outputs]
    data_out: [Integrated_Artifacts, Validation_Reports]
```

***

### 4. Interaction Protocols
```
⫻interaction:
  trigger: On_New_Objective
  sequence:
    1. Director -> Lyra: "Request prompt setup for new objective"
    2. Lyra -> GPTASe: "Compose initial TAS extraction prompt"
    3. GPTASe -> puTASe: "Deliver raw TASs for purification"
    4. puTASe -> Director: "Return validated TAS list"
    5. Director -> Aurora: "Initiate design phase using validated TASs"
    6. Aurora -> Kodax: "Provide workflow schematics"
    7. Kodax -> Deliverable_Integrator: "Assemble orchestration logic"
    8. Deliverable_Integrator -> Director: "Submit final validation report"
```

***

### 5. Knowledge Graph Integration
```
⫻kicklang:
  connect: KnowledgeGraph.Engine
  schema:
    - entity: Phase
      properties: [phase_id, name, objectives, agents]
    - entity: Task
      properties: [task_id, subtask_of, owner, state, output_ref]
    - entity: Communication
      properties: [actor, recipient, content, timestamp, phase_ref]
  auto_update: true
  update_trigger: On_Phase_Transition
```

***

### 6. Feedback and Refinement Loops
```
⫻loop:
  condition: Evaluation < Threshold
  actions:
    - Director -> Agents: "Initiate refinement protocol"
    - Agents produce: [Revised Outputs]
    - Meta-Communication logs adjustment reason
```
