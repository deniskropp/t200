# Context
The current `README.md` only contains the title "# T200".
The project "Orion Collective Orchestration System" (OCS) has a defined structure in `src/` (api, cli, core, shared, ui) and dependencies in `pyproject.toml` (FastAPI, React/Vite implied by UI, etc.).
It is time to document the project's purpose and usage for developers.

# Objectives
1. **Update README.md**:
   - **Header**: Project Title (OCS) and Description.
   - **Features**: Highlight the modular architecture (API, CLI, Core, UI).
   - **Tech Stack**: Mention Python 3.12+, FastAPI, Pydantic v2, Rich, SQLAlchemy (Async).
   - **Installation**: Instructions for setting up the environment (likely `pip install -e .[dev]`).
   - **Usage**: Basic commands (e.g., how to run the CLI or API).

# Constraints
- Use standard Markdown.
- Ensure information aligns with the actual code in `src/`.
- Reference `pyproject.toml` for dependencies and scripts.
